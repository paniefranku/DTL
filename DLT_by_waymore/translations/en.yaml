blueprint:
  name: Dynamic Light Temperature
  description: >
    Automatically adjusts the color temperature of selected lights based on time of day and brightness.
    In the evening and at night, the light becomes warmer. Lower brightness means warmer color.
    You can also temporarily block automatic updates – e.g. after manually changing the color temperature.

  input:
    lights:
      name: Lights to control
      description: Lights whose color temperature will be adjusted automatically.

    update_block:
      name: Block automatic changes
      description: >
        Optional toggle (input_boolean) that blocks automatic temperature changes,
        e.g. after a manual adjustment.

    sunset_offset:
      name: Sunset offset (minutes)
      description: Time offset (in minutes) from the actual sunset time.

    night_fraction:
      name: Warm-up duration after sunset (night fraction)
      description: >
        Fraction of the night used to gradually warm up the color temperature after sunset.

    cool_start:
      name: Start time of morning cooldown (hour)
      description: Hour (0–23) when the light should begin to cool down back to daylight temperature.

    cool_end:
      name: End time of morning cooldown (hour)
      description: Hour (0–23) when the cooldown ends and daylight color is restored.

    warm_ratio:
      name: Warm-up ratio for lower brightness
      description: >
        Defines how much the light warms up based on lower brightness levels.

    min_temp_offset:
      name: Increase minimum color temperature (K)
      description: Shifts the minimum allowed color temperature upward.

    max_temp_offset:
      name: Decrease maximum color temperature (K)
      description: Lowers the maximum allowed color temperature.

    manual_threshold:
      name: Manual change detection threshold (K)
      description: >
        If the current light temperature deviates by more than this value (in Kelvin),
        the automation assumes a manual override and activates the block toggle.
